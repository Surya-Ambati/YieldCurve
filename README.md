#Analyzing the Yield Curve - Python Implementation
This repository contains Python code and implementations based on the book "Analyzing the Yield Curve" by Moorad Choudhry. The goal is to explore concepts related to yield curve analysis, term structure modeling, and bond market dynamics using Python.

#Project Overview
Implement key concepts from the book using Python.
Analyze different yield curve models (e.g., Nelson-Siegel, Vasicek, CIR).
Visualize and interpret yield curves with real market data.
Build tools for yield curve fitting, forecasting, and risk analysis.
